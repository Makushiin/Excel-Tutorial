2. **Common Formulas**: Mastering functions like `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `IF`, and others to streamline calculations.
3. **XLOOKUP**: Efficiently retrieving data from specified ranges.
4. **Conditional Formatting**: Enhancing data visualization by highlighting key trends and anomalies.
5. **Charts**: Crafting visually appealing and informative charts to present data effectively.
6. **Data Cleaning**: Preparing datasets for analysis by removing duplicates, handling missing data, and standardizing formats.

## Features of the Project
- **Dynamic Pivot Tables**: Used for summarizing and analyzing datasets.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Combining charts and formatted tables to provide a comprehensive view of the data.
- **Automated Data Cleaning**: Utilizing formulas and Excel tools to preprocess raw data efficiently.

## What I Learned
This project reinforced my understanding of Excel as a versatile tool for:
- Transforming raw data into actionable insights.
- Creating professional-level reports and dashboards.
- Managing and analyzing datasets efficiently.

## Next Steps
I aim to continue improving my skills in Excel by:
